OSSO build of sedutil-cli + linuxpba (OPAL/SED)
===============================================

Using Docker::

    ./Dockerfile.build

If the build succeeds, the built Debian packages are placed inside (a
subdirectory of) ``Dockerfile.out/``.

Note that use of ``linuxpba`` is both untested and requires additional work
See the description in the `control`_ file.
